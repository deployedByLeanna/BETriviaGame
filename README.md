# Bloom Energy Trivia Game

The BE Trivia Game was created to showcase the features I have created/implemented into the LMS(Learning Managment System).

Articulate Storyline 360 applications were used to design UX features that apply instructional learning psychology to the courses, which in turn allow the users to practice and retain information with built-in interactivity.

## Features


New features created:

- Scalable Design Language
    - This course was created with the "Content Template" wireframe that allows users to easily create their own course, yet fit within the design language of the LMS. Many slides/sections were created for users to create content efficiently.


- Knowledge Checks (Checkpoints)
    - Course will now be broken into appropriate sections to review knowledge with:
        - Review Cards
        - Q/A Text Entry
        - Q/A Multiple Choice
        - Q/A Drag-n-Drop


- Enhanced Motion animations
    - Over 1000+ objects were animated over the course of my internship.
    - Each slide has a streamlined animations for ease of information presentation and processing, and better retention.


- Object Dialog States
    - Based on user interactivity, objects will display different information and objects will change states to indicate selected or correct answers.
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform
